## Overview

Often times when we look at a website, we are confronted with new terms. Instead of having to individually right click on every single term to look up the definition, this extension will create a bank of vocab words on the article and display their meanings. If you click the extension's button, you will see the list of words and their definitions. You can also save words for future reference.

## Installation

1. conda install beautifulsoup4
2. Install virtual environment: python -m venv env
3. Activate virtual env: source env/bin/activate

## Libraries

1. Beautiful Soup: Python library to pull data out of HTML and XML files. It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data from HTML, which is useful for web scraping.

2. lxml library: parser that works well even with broken HTML code
